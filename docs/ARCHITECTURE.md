## Overview

Clear Ledger is a **local-first** Android app: categories define optional custom field schemas; invoices store aligned value lists and explicit service period modes. Clear Ledger does not send your data to the developer or operate its own cloud service; data is stored locally. User-initiated export and manual backup use Storage Access Framework (SAF). Android system backup may apply per device settings.

**Stack:** Kotlin · Jetpack Compose (Material 3) · Navigation Compose · Room v16 · MVVM-style separation

A minimal Play Integrity **Standard** client (`core/integrity/`) exists for a future online attestation path; it is **not** wired into UI or product flows yet (prepare-only; no token/`requestHash`/backend verify in this stage).

---

## Privacy and local-first design

- No account, developer cloud sync, backend, or analytics — app data in local Room storage
- Clear Ledger does not transmit data to the developer; Android system backup may apply per device settings
- Manual export and backup are **user-initiated** via Storage Access Framework
- Backup ZIPs contain **plaintext JSON** with sensitive financial data — users must store them securely
- Restore is full replace only; validation runs before any data is deleted

---

## MVVM layers

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| **View (Compose)** | Stateless screens; collect `StateFlow` with `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`; SAF launchers for file I/O |
| **ViewModel** | UI state, user intents, repository calls, derived pipelines (e.g. search/filter/sort) |
| **Repository** | Abstract persistence; map Room entities ↔ domain models |
| **Room** | SQLite source of truth (entities, DAOs, migrations, type converters) |

**Data flow:** `UI → ViewModel → Repository → Room → Repository → ViewModel → UI`

**ViewModel scoping:** Related screens share a parent `NavBackStackEntry` (e.g. invoice list, add/edit, details share `InvoiceListViewModel`). Repositories are wired in `MainActivity` and ViewModel factories — no DI framework.

**Play Integrity (prepare-only, Sep 2026):** `core/integrity/PlayIntegrityClient` wraps `StandardIntegrityManager` and can warm up a `StandardIntegrityTokenProvider` using `BuildConfig.PLAY_INTEGRITY_CLOUD_PROJECT_NUMBER`. Not constructed from `MainActivity` yet; token request + `requestHash` + backend verification are later stages.

---

## Domain model highlights

- **Category:** `customFieldTitles: List<String>` (max 10), `orderIndex`, `seedKey`, `userEdited`, colors, pinned defaults
- **Invoice:** core billing fields + `customFieldValues: List<String>` aligned **by index** to category titles
- **Invoice attachment fields:** `attachmentFileName`/`attachmentDisplayName`/`attachmentMimeType` — one local image/PDF attachment (Aug 2026), copied into app-private storage; `attachmentUri` — legacy persisted `content://` Uri for invoices not yet migrated. All local-only, excluded from backup/restore
- **ServicePeriodMode:** `MONTH` or `DATE` — explicit source of truth; never inferred from dates alone
- **InvoiceCurrency:** ILS / USD display metadata only — amounts are not converted

See `core/domain/Models.kt` for full contracts.

---

## Repositories

| Repository | Responsibility |
|------------|----------------|
| `RoomCategoryRepository` | CRUD, seeded localization, manual reorder |
| `RoomInvoiceRepository` | CRUD per category, entity ↔ domain mapping |
| `RoomBackupRestoreRepository` | Transactional full-replace restore from `BackupPayload` |

Room database is currently **version 16** with incremental, non-destructive migrations. Avoid schema changes unless explicitly planned and tested.

---

## Compose screens and navigation

Routes are defined in `core/ui/Navigation.kt` (`Screen` sealed class). Category list is the start destination. Invoice screens require `categoryId`; edit/details require `invoiceId`.

**Key feature modules:**
- `feature/category/` — list, add/edit, reorder, export-all-data entry point (backup/restore/reset UI lives in `feature/settings/SettingsScreen`, sharing `CategoryListViewModel`)
- `feature/invoice/` — list, add/edit/details, search/filter/sort, CSV export
- `feature/settings/` — Settings hub screen (Language, Text size, Backup/Restore, Reset, About entry points), manual language switch, About

One-shot snackbar feedback uses `savedStateHandle` flags (e.g. after add/delete).

Back navigation uses a `popIfSafe()` helper (Navigation.kt) that checks `previousBackStackEntry != null` (a public API) before calling `popBackStack()`. All toolbar and programmatic back actions go through this helper. `CategoryList` also registers `BackHandler(enabled = true)` to absorb rapid system back presses. Together these ensure the start destination is never popped and the NavHost cannot be left blank.

---

## Export (human-readable)

**Not for restore.** Localized CSV/ZIP for spreadsheets and personal records.

| Entry | Output | Scope |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Invoice list → Export | `.csv` via SAF | `visibleInvoices` after search/filter/sort |
| Category list → Export all data | `.zip` via SAF | `categories.csv` + invoice CSVs per category with invoices |

**Implementation:** Pure Kotlin in `core/util/` (`InvoiceCsvExporter`, `AllDataZipExporter`, `Utf8CsvWriter`). Labels follow **app locale only** (English or Hebrew). ViewModels supply data/strings; Compose screens write bytes via SAF.

**Known limitation:** Google Sheets on Android may misread mixed English-header / Hebrew-data CSV. Do not add encoding hacks; LibreOffice and desktop Sheets are the target.

### Share Sheet (Aug 2026)

Both export flows above stage the same bytes they write to SAF in an app-cache file (`cacheDir/exports/`), then offer a **Share** action on the success snackbar. Sharing uses `androidx.core.content.FileProvider` (declared in `AndroidManifest.xml`, paths scoped to `cacheDir/exports/` via `res/xml/file_paths.xml`) to mint a temporary `content://` Uri, and `Intent.ACTION_SEND` + `Intent.createChooser` (see `core/util/ShareExportUtil.kt`) to open the standard Android Share Sheet with `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION`. No `file://` Uri is ever exposed, no broad storage permission is required, and there is no direct Gmail/Drive integration — the chooser simply lists whatever compatible apps are installed. The SAF save flow is unchanged; sharing is additive only.

---

## Invoice attachments (Aug 2026, app-private storage, local-only)

One optional image or PDF attachment per invoice, added/replaced/removed from the Add/Edit invoice form and opened from Invoice Details. The picked document is copied into the app's own private storage, so the user can delete or move the original source file afterwards without breaking the attachment.

| Step | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Pick | `ActivityResultContracts.OpenDocument()`, `arrayOf("image/*", "application/pdf")` — standard SAF picker, no broad storage permission |
| Copy | The picked document's bytes are copied into `filesDir/invoice_attachments/` under a random, collision-safe filename, off the main thread (`core/util/AttachmentStorage.kt`); its display name and MIME type are captured at copy time and stored alongside, since they can't be re-queried once the source is gone |
| Store reference | `Invoice.attachmentFileName`/`attachmentDisplayName`/`attachmentMimeType` reference the managed copy — the original source document is no longer needed after a successful copy |
| Open | `Intent.ACTION_VIEW` on a `content://` Uri minted for the managed file via the app's `FileProvider` (`res/xml/file_paths.xml`, `invoice_attachments/` path entry) + `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION`; never `file://` |
| Cleanup | A pending, never-saved copy (replaced again, removed, or the form discarded) is deleted directly — each copy is a brand-new file nothing else could reference yet. The invoice's actual saved managed file is deleted only after a real save/delete succeeds, and only if no other persisted invoice still references it (`InvoiceRepository.countInvoicesWithAttachmentFileName`) |
| Failures | Missing/inaccessible file, a failed copy, or no compatible viewer app surface as a snackbar message (existing `SwipeDismissSnackbarHost` pattern) — never a crash |

**Legacy invoices:** those created before this storage strategy stored only a persisted external `content://` Uri (`Invoice.attachmentUri`). These migrate lazily — every time their invoice list loads, `InvoiceListViewModel.migrateLegacyAttachmentIfNeeded` tries to copy the legacy source into managed storage; if it's inaccessible, the invoice (and its legacy reference) is left untouched and retried on the next load. No Room migration performs file I/O directly.

**Room:** `InvoiceEntity.attachmentUri` (legacy, nullable `TEXT`, added via `MIGRATION_14_15`); `attachmentFileName`/`attachmentDisplayName`/`attachmentMimeType` (nullable `TEXT`, added via `MIGRATION_15_16`, purely additive); database bumped 15 → 16.

**Backup/restore limitation (temporary):** all attachment fields are deliberately excluded from `BackupInvoiceDto`/`BackupMapper` — the managed attachment copy is local to the device and attachment-aware backup/restore (including whether to package the files themselves into the backup ZIP) will be implemented in the next stage. Existing backups remain restorable unchanged. CSV export, Export all data ZIP, and Share Sheet are unaffected. No broad storage permission, `MediaStore`, or cloud storage is used.

---

## Backup and restore (app data)

**Backup** = restore-ready ZIP with single `backup.json` (raw enums, ISO dates, IDs, custom fields — not localized display strings).

**Restore** = full replace of local categories and invoices from a valid backup ZIP only.

| Step | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Pick file | SAF `OpenDocument` |
| Validate | `BackupZipImporter` + `BackupValidator` — **before** any DB mutation |
| Confirm | Destructive dialog (EN + HE) only after validation succeeds |
| Apply | `RoomBackupRestoreRepository` — `withTransaction` delete all + insert; preserves original IDs |
| Post-restore | Seeding flags updated; `last_applied_language` set to current locale to prevent re-localization of restored category names on next launch; language preference unchanged |

CSV/ZIP exports are **rejected** at validation. Plaintext backup files contain sensitive data — user must store them securely.

Pure Kotlin utilities live in `core/util/backup/`.

---

## Localization

- Manual Hebrew / English switch; preference persisted via `LanguagePreferenceManager`
- Locale applied in `attachBaseContext`; Compose respects RTL/LTR via `LocalLayoutDirection`
- Resources: `values/` (English), `values-iw/` (Hebrew)
- Seeded categories re-localize on language change unless `userEdited == true`
- Reset all data seeds default categories using a locale-correct context built from the saved language preference, ensuring the correct locale is applied regardless of how the Compose context was captured
- Export headers and display values follow active app locale

---

## Validation strategy

Validation is layered so bad input never corrupts local data.

### Forms (UI)
- Category and invoice save flows validate required fields before repository calls
- Scroll-to-first-invalid on failed save; errors surfaced via inline state and snackbars

### Backup restore (defensive)
- `BackupValidator` checks format version, required fields, positive unique IDs, enum/date validity, orphan invoice rejection
- Failed validation → error snackbar; **current data unchanged**
- Successful validation → user must confirm destructive replace

### Domain invariants (preserve in code and tests)
1. Custom field values align by index with category titles — do not filter/reindex in ways that break alignment
2. Service period mode is explicit — never infer from dates
3. Category list sorted by `orderIndex`, not name
4. Export vs backup vs restore remain distinct product paths
5. Hidden category fields (`supplierName`, `pinnedDefaults`) round-trip on update
6. Invoice attachment changes (`attachmentFileName`/`attachmentUri`) count as unsaved changes in the add/edit form, same as any other field

### Automated tests (S9 — done)
- Unit tests for export utilities, backup mapper/exporter/importer/validator
- Targeted tests for custom-field alignment, CSV edge cases, invalid restore rejection, EN/HE export labels

Optional stretch: Room migration smoke tests, instrumented restore transaction test.

## Testing and CI

Local quality gate (mirrored in CI):

```bash
./gradlew test
./gradlew lintDebug
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

**GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/android-ci.yml`) runs the same commands on push to `main` and on pull requests (Temurin 17).

See `docs/RELEASE.md` for release build and Play Store checklist.

### Interview demo flow

Category list → add/edit category → invoice list → search/filter/sort → CSV export → create backup → restore (with validation) → switch language → highlight local-first / no cloud design. Full checklist in `docs/RELEASE.md`.
